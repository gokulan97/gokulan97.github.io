				<br>
				2021 without any doubt will go down as one of the worst years of my life. But the five hours
				on October 15 will easily top my most happiest moments of 2021. And it is for this very same
				reason, I wanted to jolt this down and reflect on, years later.
				<br><br>
				Before starting, it is important to reflect back on the week that
				preceded the final. I just had a long weekend till Tue, and was coming into the week fresh with
				an exam Thu evening. However, because my exam clashed with my TA commitment for office
				hours, I had to reschedule my office hours. Now, postponing it to Fri is a no-brainer.
				However, I was so 'pump'ed up for the final that I did not want to do any work on Fri.
				Contrarily, the OOP course I was TA for had a project deadline on Wed... easily one of those
				days I wouldn't prefer rescheduling it to. Finally, my adulation for the Final overpowered
				the consequence of fatigue and I ended up holding office hours for six hours straight on Wed
				- only for the Professor to extend the deadline till Sun. Eventually, it wasn't as bad as I thought it to be.
				<br><br>
				And the exam day came. Not that it was 
				a big day where the exam had high significance - it was just a midterm; but I'll remember
				it as one of the last exams I wrote during my college life. Only when I boarded the bus
				in the afternoon at 1, of all the days I've been going to campus, did I realise that I forgot
				my ID card (yes, we used to show ID cards and sign attendance sheets when colleges
				happened in person). But the exam was only in the evening at 7. I still had ample time to
				finish classes, come back home, pickup the card and head back to exam. An inner me disregarded
				thinking it wasn't needed until a classmate told me it was needed. I ended up taking the bus
				home and walking back 1.5 miles to campus to make it in time. At this point, I was at x=&#960;
				of the cos wave - it only got better after this.

				<br><br>
				I ended up thulping the exam (topped actually), and did my laundry - the last three instances
				of me watching CSK match in the 2nd leg of IPL with the yellow t-shirt were all wins. Not that
				it would have mattered, but I didn't want to feel bad later that CSK didn't win because I didn't
				wear the tshirt had they lost. Ordered and hearts out ate my favourite pizza and went
				to bed early by relative standards at 12AM, all excited for the big day.
				<br><br><br>
				<i>15 October 2021, 8.30AM:</i> Woke up to my regular alarm, snoozed it and finally pulled
				myself out of bed at 45. Got fresh and checked the toss at 9.30 as I measured rava to make upma - KKR won the toss and opted
				to bowl. My heart paused for a moment - every stastical extrapolation went KKR's way:
				a) Dubai hasn't been the best place to chase for it was difficult to gauge a winning score.
				Every chasing team knew exactly how much to score and paced their innings well that the chance
				of winning was heavily skewed towards the chasing team. b) CSK hasn't been their best at
				defending - the last three losses in the league stage came while defending. c) KKR chased down
				scores of 190 and 199 in the previous finals when they won trophies. However, CSK always
				has the habit of springing in surprises - starting X1 throwing all pre-season analysis down
				the sink, messing up easy chase to pull off a heist and in the future, Shardul Thakur will
				provide one such 19th over.
				<br><br><br>
				<i>10.05AM:</i> Was supposed to sit in front of my computer exactly at 10 with upma
				and coffee, but an important call meant I couldn't make it in time; and ended up forgetting
				to add ghee to upma at the end (on a different note, rava upma doesn't deserve the hate it gets).
				Eventually, started watching at 6/0 in 1 ov. Another quite over and it seemed all normal 
				until Shakib came back for his second over - Rutu took on the spinner and made sure KKR don't
				get cheap overs from Shakib from the powerplay. By the time powerplay ended, CSK were 50/0
				in 6 overs - above-average powerplay. Then came the crucial matchup everyone talked about:
				CSK batting vs mystery spin of Naraine an VC in middle overs. Three quite overs after powerplay
				with loss of Ruturaj and I felt something had to give in - came in Shakib's over. Two sixes
				ensured KKR didn't steal another cheap over and that set the momentum for the rest of the innings.
				
				<br><br>

				Uthappa attacked, Faf kept attacking and the run rate kept lingering around 8.5-9. Going by
				past trend, I always observed CSK bring out EA cricket when they had wickets - scoring at
				15-20rpo during the last few overs. So when the score stood at 124/2 at the fall of Uthappa's
				wicket, I was optimistic of 200. Couple of quite overs after that and I thought perhaps 190.
				Moeen was 3(6) at the end of 16th. Again, something had to give in. But I had to hop onto
				a call with Appa and came back 10 minutes later - 35 came off the next two overs, Moeen had 
				really teed off. And so did Faf. Now, there were geniune concerns over Ruturaj's ownership
				of orange cap. I had tweeted earlier during the innings that Faf still had a chance and 
				wasn't surprised when it came this close.
				<br><br>

				<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Faf has a genuine chance of bagging the orange cap <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/IPLFinal?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#IPLFinal</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CSKvsKKR?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CSKvsKKR</a></p>&mdash; Gokulan (@sub_sp_0x4) <a href="https://twitter.com/sub_sp_0x4/status/1449025815358984197?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 15, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

				<br>

				<i>11.30ishAM:</i> Faf was 8 runs short of orange cap with two overs remaining. Moeen was also
				hitting em cleanly when VC was brought for his final over. Faf remained off strike barring
				a ball and there was still 7 needed. The attention shifted from CSK scoring 200 to Faf grabbing
				the orange cap. I was in two minds - there can only be one orange cap holder after all.
				And when Faf took the single off the penultimate ball, I thought well at least we have a result.
				But then, Morgan misfields, brings Faf back to strike and gave me one more ball to deal with.
				And Faf connects the last ball only to be caught. Alas, I atleast know that Rutu owns the orange
				cap now. And for a good ten minutes, I almost forgot to check CSK's scores. 192/3 at 20. Would
				be sufficient on most occasions, but the hype of final and KKR's previous outings in their title
				wins still didn't rule out the result.

				<br><br><br>

				<i>12PM:</i> And so did Venkatesh Iyer. Man has been hitting them cleanly with brain and brawn
				- clearing the short boundaries at will and sending missiles into orbit over deep mid. And when
				Dhoni dropped, I didn't feel it would prove to be costly. Alas, he made full use of the powerplay
				and it was advantage KKR at the end of powerplay. And came Bravo. Until I saw Ashwin's video the
				next day, I didn't know it would prove to be the game changing moment. Bowled a couple of quiet 
				overs despite Jadeja being taken down at the other end. And came THAT MOMENT - I did notice at
				first the ball hitting the SpiderCam and knew it was going to be dead. Despite all the effort,
				you always need a bit of luck going your way in a match like final - not meant to be.

				<br><br>

				At 88/0 after 10 overs, any other day, rational me would've predicted a KKR win. Perhaps even
				a script like the first league game in India in 2021 between KKR and CSK when Pat Cummins 
				played an absolute blinder. But early in the second innings came the news that Rahul Tripati
				might not bat at his usual 3 and that still made be believe a CSK win, knowing KKR's middle
				order. Having said that, felt extremely sorry for Rahul Tripathi. A watchout
				player for me starting 2017 when he amassed runs at the top for RPS. I just wish someone gives
				him a run at the top for one full season (KKR still kept messing with his position sending
				in Rana ahead of him at times, overdoing matchups and left-right combinations).

				<br><br>

				105 required off 60, 10 wickets in hand, two set batters. A wicket was definitely coming - it
				almost did last over until the ball hit SpiderCam. And the very next over, it did arrive, but
				this time of Venkatesh Iyer. And it was again, CSK's man with a golden arm, Shardul Thakur.
				Nipped out Rana in the same over and all of the sudden, one could sense a shift. Naraine came,
				connected one and fell next ball. Gill scratched around, completed his fifty and fell.
				And when DK and Shakib got out, for sure I knew Morgan and a 1.5-legged Tripathi aren't going
				to pull this off. Soon, both of them went back and I thought it was over. Wasn't to be.
				Bravo conceded big and I thought it was one off over. Then came Shardul again, kept bowling
				noballs and wides, conceded boundaries and made the mathematical possibility stay alive.
				Bravo calmly cleaned it up and then came the moment. All the statistics have been dealt with
				an outlier again.

				<br><br><br>

				<i>2PM:</i> I was satisfied with the win for one wouldn't find a more complete team performance looking at the scorecard after the match,
				especially when there are quite a few visible contributions which overpower MS' captaincy.
				I am not sure if it's a case of serendipity or an instance of good execution, but throughout
				the second innings, CSK never dropped any skiers. The only drop in the entire innings was
				by MS off Venky. In a big match like final, clinging onto skiers even after hitting cameras
				was some performance. 

				<br><br>

				Taking the entire season into context, CSK had 11 different matchwinners in their team
				who ensured the job was complete. Yes the openers scored bulk of the runs and so did the 
				openers of KXIP, but the rest of the playing X1 in CSK ensured they complemented the openers
				well to pull it off. There were at least 7 different players who produced POTM performances
				and hence draws parallels to 2018 - coming back from rock bottom to reach the pinnacle. The
				only missing performance was MS producing a 70(45) against junk pace. But title meant everything
				else was quicky forgotten.
				
				<br><br><br>

				<i>2.30PMish:</i> After some player interviews on the sidelines, banal analysis by Sunny G,
				Haydos trying to prove he still supports CSK with a purple outfit and a CSK towel, some really bad ads for the
				T20 world cup came the real presentations. Now let me take a moment to talk about Harsha Bhogle.
				There is always an aura associated with him, the cheekiness and the connect audience are able to
				make with the game through his narrative sets him apart. I hope one day Nasser Hussain,
				Ian Bishop and Harsha Bhogle do commentary together in the IPL one day and give us more <i>moments
				to remember.</i>

				<br><br>

				I always skip live presentations and watch them later - most presentations clashed with my
				classes and even when I didn't have one, the crisp videos on the website were the perfect
				ones I wanted to see. But this wasn't the day. Each word was to be comprehended with context.
				After some really good interviews with Morgan, Baz and Fleming came the ultimate conversation
				I was waiting for. Any post match interview of MS itself is cake; Harsha doing it was icing on
				the cake and this happening after a win in the final with headlines to be made was nothing short
				of Christmas. But the key takeaway from the conversation was MS talking about not letting the 
				opposition put in a 15-minute good performance which takes the game away from you (if you didn't
				get the reference, refer to a certain captain's 2019 semi-final post-match presentation).

				<br><br><br>

				<i>3.03PM:</i> MS collects the trophy, hands it to DC and the confetti flys around. Almost five
				hours after it all started, the final moment was here. I really had to rush to catch the bus at
				3.15 and that concluded things.

				Was scrolling through the timeline after boarding bus and stopped at this pic. For I felt this
				would be the fitting conclusion to this piece.

				Ruturaj Gaikwad. I've been following him ever since he was roped
				into the CSK side in 2019, when he kept scoring truckload of runs for India A, especially
				in the India A's tour of WI. Came IPL 2020, so did COVID and three successive failures in the
				middle order and was eventually dropped. However, at least for me, his real trough came when
				MS mentioned he lacked 'spark' - yes, the season was in tantrums and the team's performance was poor.
				But MS of all people, who's known to back young players and for CSK of all teams, saying an 
				young player lacking 'spark' - how does one even deal with it? And to come back
				from that position to score three Player of the Match performances at the end of 2020 and
				finishing the season with orange cap in 2021 is no small feat.
				And I better not start talking about his performances in 2021.
				It was a privilege watching the entire innings of 88<sup>*</sup>, 
				101<sup>*</sup> and Q1 live wearing the aforementioned yellow tshirt. And I couldn't feel
				any happier for him when I saw this pic. Superseding all the wishes I've made so far in this 
				piece, I want him to be the fulcrum of CSK's batting for the next 10 years and if possible,
				want to see him play alongside Pujara in a test match.
